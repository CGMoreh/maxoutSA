The target population is all UK undergraduates studying on a Japanese or/and Korean language/studies course that has a compulsory study abroad year or semester as part of the degree.\nIt aims to interview UK undergraduate students on a Japanese or Korean course at three time-points during their university and post-university careers:"

    "text": "Project timeline\nThe Pilot phase of the project began in the 2019/2020 academic year, with an online survey distributed between March-May 2020. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, study abroad travel on all 3-year degrees was put on hold and due to the general uncertainty regarding study abroad, the project was unable to collect data as planned from all the sampled institutions, and the qualitative interview data collection was also put on hold. Most of the data originated from the then home institution of the research team members, and following a transition to 4-year degrees and a better outlook on the future containment of the pandemic, a new cohort (from a single post-1992 university) was surveyed in October 2020, and qualitative interview data on a smaller selected sample of the respondents was also collected.\nThese two cohorts make up the single-institution pilot phase of the project, and in the 2023/2024 academic year Cohort P2 students (the first post-pandemic student cohort to have taken part in study abroad in their third year of studies on a 4-year degree) also returned from study abroad, making possible the first post-SA data collection round.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1: MAXOUT data collection timeline\n\n\n\nA funding application is made to implement the first cross-institutional first-year (pre-SA) cohort survey (MAXOUT-SA 1.1.1). This will enable the research team to address the body of research questions that aims to investigate the connections between social mobility and international student mobility on a nationally representative sample. The project cross-section for which funding is sought is highlighted in light grey in the chart below."

Respondent e-mail addresses and IP Addresses are also helpful for identifying any data reliability issues, such as duplicate responses (n.b. the IPAddress collected by Qualtrics© is “external”, so those connecting to the same network will share an IP). We find four email addresses with duplicate responses, and we will keep the earlier responses. The reason for this choice is that the information from the later responses could be contaminated by having previously completed the survey already (practice effects). Incidentally, the earlier responses also have fewer missing answers (albeit marginally, a difference of one in two cases).\nThe code below checks duplicates and removes them (suppressing the output for reasons of anonymity):\n\n#### Identify case duplicates (by email) -------------------------------------------------------\n\npreSA |&gt; \n  mutate(dupe = duplicated(preSA$email)) |&gt; \n  janitor::get_dupes(email) |&gt; \n  select(email, IPAddress, dupe_count, dupe, Random_ID, StartDate) |&gt; \n  datawizard::data_to_wide(id_cols = c(\"email\", \"dupe_count\"), names_from = \"dupe\", values_from = \"Random_ID\")\n\n# or\npreSA |&gt; \n  mutate(duplicate = duplicated(preSA$email)) |&gt; \n  data_duplicated(select = \"email\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::add_count(email, name = \"count_duplicates\") |&gt; \n  data_select(c(\"email\", \"IPAddress\", \"count_duplicates\", \"duplicate\", \"Random_ID\", \"StartDate\", \"count_na\"))\n\n## Counting IPAddress is less useful due to shared addresses at campus/dormitory\npreSA |&gt; \n  janitor::get_dupes(IPAddress) |&gt; \n  select(email, IPAddress, dupe_count, Random_ID, StartDate)\n\n\n#### Identify case duplicates (by email) -------------------------------------------------------\n\npreSA |&gt; \n  mutate(dupe = duplicated(preSA$email)) |&gt; \n  janitor::get_dupes(email) |&gt; \n  select(email, IPAddress, dupe_count, dupe, Random_ID, StartDate) |&gt; \n  datawizard::data_to_wide(id_cols = c(\"email\", \"dupe_count\"), names_from = \"dupe\", values_from = \"Random_ID\") |&gt; \n  datawizard::data_rename(c(\"dupe_count\", \"FALSE\", \"TRUE\"), c(\"No. of duplicate emails\", \"ID_first\", \"ID_second\")) |&gt; \n  select(!email) |&gt; \n  tinytable::tt()\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_xwsd8y3yuu85i95je9ii\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                No. of duplicate emails\n                ID_first\n                ID_second\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  2\n                  9419 \n                  8436 \n                \n                \n                  2\n                  9514 \n                  8175 \n                \n                \n                  2\n                  95339\n                  70145\n                \n                \n                  2\n                  84953\n                  44422\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n#### Will delete the later responses (incidentally, these also have fewer NAs) -----------------\n`%not_in%` = Negate(`%in%`)\n\npreSA &lt;- preSA |&gt; \n  data_filter(Random_ID %not_in% c(\"8436\", \"8175\", \"70145\", \"44422\"))    # keeps original \"rownames\"; `rownames(preSA) &lt;- NULL` to renumber\n\n# or:  \n# preSA &lt;- preSA |&gt; \n#   dplyr::filter(!Random_ID %in% c(\"8436\", \"8175\", \"70145\", \"44422\"))   # renumbers \"rownames\"\n# or:\n# preSA_alt &lt;- data_unique(preSA, select = \"email\", keep = \"first\")      ## Deletes all attributes!!\n\nThis leaves us with 179 responses/cases/rows.\nWe can also check whether any Random_ID numbers have been allocated multiple times (unfortunately, Qualtrics© doesn’t have a system to fine-tune the randomisation of numbers…).

    "text": "The MAXOUT Study Abroad project (Motivations, Aspiration, Expectations, Experiences and Outcomes of Study Abroad among UK undergraduates studying Japanese and Korean) is envisaged as a longitudinal cross-institutional mixed-methods research project investigating the socio-cultural mechanisms linking study motivations, career aspirations, expectations and experiences of international mobility, and the differential social mobility potentials of UK university students enrolled on a Japanese or Korean programme containing a compulsory Study Abroad (SA) year.\nThe project’s focus derives from several observations made in connection to recent trends affecting UK higher education. Research on outward student mobility has highlighted the relevance of social class and parental income to university students’ ability and interest to participate in international exchange programmes, which in turn affects international career opportunities and connections (Findlay and King, 2010; King et al., 2011; Lörz et al., 2016). Particularly, student mobility to continental Europe has been declining for over two decades, with interest shifting to more distant and more expensive English-speaking countries such as the USA or Australia (Findlay et al., 2006). This trend has paralleled a decreasing interest in foreign language study and declining recruitment to undergraduate degrees in languages.\nHowever, two languages in particular – Japanese and Korean – have challenged this trend, with the number of undergraduate degree programmes and student numbers in Japanese and Korean seeing major increases in recent years (HESA, 2023b). One reason may be the attraction of the competing pop-cultural influences of these countries, one of the most successful developments in soft-power public diplomacy since the demise of the “Britpop” cultural movement of the 1990s (Hashimoto, 2018; Jang and Paik, 2012; Koma, 2012; Lee, 2009; Sanz and Carbó-Catalan, 2022). Most undergraduate programmes in Japanese and Korean include a compulsory year abroad component, which may represent a further motivating factor for students with fewer resources to travel to these countries outside the formalised framework of a university degree. This compulsory year abroad plays an essential role in shaping social and cultural identities, facilitating intercultural contact and challenging imagined idealisations of the countries visited (Kinginger, 2013; Mitchell et al., 2015).\nHowever, the interactive social mechanisms linking macro-political factors such as soft power competition, language-learning motivations, career and international mobility aspirations, and social mobility, have not yet been comprehensively studied. This project attempts to gain insights into these mechanisms."
